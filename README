Election Sentiment Analysis

This project scrapes twitter posts discussing Santa Cruz's Measure M. Using Scikit Learn,
we perform sentiment analysis to determine how people will vote in the upcoming elections.

A separate Bidirectional RNN sentiment analysis model is created using a recurrent computational graph defined by a Keras model. The relative performance and accuracy of both models will be benchmarked in subsequent tests.
